# Ticket Tracker

## About this tracker

This tracker is a simple program, which allows you to keep track of the number of tickets each employee is using. There is no limit to the number of tickets one employy can work on at any given time, however it can never be less than zero since you can't do negative work.

## How to use

Using the tracker is quite simple. To increment the ticket count, press the + button at the bottom of the employee card you wish to increase the ticket count of. On the flip side, pressing the - button will decrease the ticket count.
